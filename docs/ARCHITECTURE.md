# Rendering architecture

The library does not independently calculate the full astronomical ephemeris or interpretation. It depends on precomputed planetary positions and house inputs. Some aspect selection and derived visual elements are computed during rendering.

## Components and current coupling

- `src/public-api.ts` exports render service, models, skin manager and basic Three.js primitives.
- `GraficoRenderService` is a root Angular singleton that owns WebGL resources, canvas, camera and scene.
- Scene composition uses `CartaAstraleCreaScena`, `LatitudiniRender`, and modular ring renderers.
- Some visual configuration and dimensions are global. `GraficoRenderService` serializes scene construction and export across its instances, restores the dimensions at the start of each operation, and waits for its scene textures. Direct calls to lower-level renderer functions and concurrent changes to global configuration remain outside this protection.
- Symbols, textures and resonator images currently live outside this package in VirgoStars `public/assets/`.
- Astrolabio uses a separate headless bundling/resolution path and must be regression-tested before updates.

## Source of truth

The new repository is a collaboration workspace only until a versioned integration is approved. The live site and sold Astrolabio devices continue to depend on the original `virgo-stars` code. Never silently switch imports, publish npm releases, or ship hardware updates.

## Optional model metadata when hydrating saved charts

The `Tema` and `TemaLocalDB` constructors retain the declared optional `sesso` value from a saved record. `TemaForm` also retains its optional form-only `stato` field while inheriting `Tema` hydration. Missing fields remain `undefined`, and empty strings are not replaced by defaults. This applies to web and offline LocalDB records; it does not change calculation inputs, timezone conversion or WebGL drawing.

Run `npm run test:model-hydration` to exercise these constructors using synthetic records. The test does not replace browser, original-artwork, or Astrolabio hardware verification.
